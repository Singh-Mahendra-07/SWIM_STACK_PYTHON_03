SIMPLE URL SHORTNER USING TINYURL AND PYSHORTNER

This Python program is a simple URL shortener application.

** Required Libraries: **

tkinter: Used for creating the GUI of the application.
pyshorteners: Used for shortening the URLs.

Functionality:

The program creates a simple GUI where the user can enter a long URL and get a shortened URL in return.
The user can also clear the text boxes with the “Clear” button.

Functions:

shorten_url(): Takes the long URL from the user input, shortens it using the pyshorteners library, and displays the shortened URL in the GUI. If an error occurs during this process, it shows an error message.
clear_textboxes(): Clears the text boxes for the long URL and the shortened URL.
Please ensure that you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

" pip install tkinter pyshorteners "

This program does not require any additional files to run. 
However, please ensure that you have a stable internet connection as the pyshorteners library needs to connect to the internet to shorten URLs.
